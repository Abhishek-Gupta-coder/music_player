# music_player
This is my first HTML ,CSS and JS project. In this project I developed a music playlist which works on both PC and Mobiles.  
Please note if you are going to use this project and uploading some where else then please mention my github account there.  
My github account is https://github.com/Harshmishra07  
To edit songs or to add more songs goto Musics folder (to change or add music) , and goto Images folder(to change or add images respective to your songs)  
**NOTE**  
make sure that both song and images name is same other wise the site did not show your song.  
after coping the files goto music.js and  
{  
    name:"song_name", //**make sure that both name and title were same as the name of song and image**.  
    title:"song_title",  
    singer:"singer_name",     
},  
copy this onto the array of songs and you have completed all steps.  
If you have any doubts please ask me.  
Enjoy!!!!.
